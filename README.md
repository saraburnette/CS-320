How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
In this project, the code has been designed with a strong emphasis on both functionality and security. The 'Contact' class is thoroughly tested using the JUnit framework, covering various scenarios such as valid contact creation and handling of invalid inputs. Input validation methods within the class, such as 'validatePhone', contribute to the system's security by ensuring that data adheres to specific formats. Code reviews are implemented as part of the development process to catch potential issues early, and adherence to secure coding practices, such as proper exception handling, bolsters the overall security of the software.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding and meeting user needs are core principles guiding the development of this project. The 'ContactService' class, responsible for managing contacts, provides methods that align with user expectations. The system employs user stories, surverys, and usability testing to interpret and incorporate user needs effectively. Regular communication with stakeholders and end-users establishes a feedback loop, allowing for continuous refinement of features based on user feedback.
How do I approach designing software?
For this project, I used a more systematic approach to design. The 'ContactService' class encapsulates the logic for managing contacts, promoting modularity, and maintainability. The 'Contact' class, desgined with immutability in mind, represents a well-defined entity in the system. The design process is iterative, allowing for continuous refinement as the project progresses. Overall, the project embraces a holistic design that combines best practices, design patterns, and adaptability to meet evolving project needs.
